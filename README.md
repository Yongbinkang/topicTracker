# TopicTracker

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
Topic trajectory information provides precious insight into the dynamics of topics and enlightens evolution relationships between topics over a given time. 
Nevertheless, the implementation of a large body of the existing methods for Topic trajectory identification is not available as usable software. To tackle this issue, we have developed <b>TopicTracker</b> that is a platform for topic trajectory identification and visualisation. The key TopicTracker is that it can represent the three facets of information together: (a) evolutionary pathways of dynamic topics with evolution strengths, (b) evolution states of the topics and (c) the topic importance. TopicTracker is a publicly available software implemented as a package for the R software.
