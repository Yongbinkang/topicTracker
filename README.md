# TopicTracker

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
Topic trajectory information provides precious insight into the dynamics of topics and enlightens evolution relationships between topics over a given time. 
Nevertheless, the implementation of a large body of the existing methods for Topic trajectory identification is not available as usable software. To tackle this issue, we have developed <b>TopicTracker</b> that is a platform for topic trajectory identification and visualisation. The key of <b>TopicTracker</b> is that it can represent the three facets of information together: (a) evolutionary pathways of dynamic topics with evolution strengths, (b) evolution states of the topics and (c) the topic importance. <b>TopicTracker</b> is a publicly available software implemented as a package for the R software.

## Setup Instruction
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Yongbinkang/topicTracker.git
```
2. Install R packages: igraph, hash, plotrix, formattable
3. Install Jupyter notebook and R Kernel (IRkernel) for Jupyter (e.g., refer to [this](https://dzone.com/articles/using-r-on-jupyternbspnotebook))

## Directory structure
* The __`src/`__ directory contains the source code and demo code for <b>TopicTracker</b>:
  * The `topicTracker.R`contains the main source code for <b>TopicTracker</b> that define how to build a Topic Evolution Tree (TET) and visualise it using igraph. For more details about the code, please refer to our paper (see below).
  * The `TopicTrackerDemo.ipynb` contains the demo code on Jupyter notebook using R Kernel. Users can simply run the sequential steps using the provided data.
* The __`data/`__ directory contains two examples used in `TopicTrackerDemo.ipynb`. 
  * the first one is a simpler one
  * the second one is generated as an example that provides a topic evolution of the 4 topics generated by a topic modelling technique from the USPTO patent data (United States Patent and Trademark Office) from 2000 - 2018, annotated with Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) code, 'A61K' (PREPARATIONS FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL, OR TOILET PURPOSES). Presenting the details of the applied topic modelling is beyond the scope of this work. 

## A TET Example

The TET shows the follows:
 * Evolutionary pathways of 11 topics with evolution strengths, indicated by the directed edges with different edge colors, 
 * Evolution states of the topics, indicated by different node colors and sizes 
 * The topic popularity indicated by topic weight information on the y-axis.
